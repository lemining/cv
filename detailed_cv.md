# summary

I'm a goal oriented professional with a consistent record of exceeding performance expectations.

Most recently I have been involved in digital transformations of large non-digital businesses to fulfil on their digital strategies resulting in extra revenue streams as well as increasing digital awareness throughout the business.

These opportunities involved building high performing Development and Quality Assurance teams from the ground up. The work also revolved around introducing processes and educating the business on how to become digital centric.

I’m a strong believer in a flat management structure with minimal or no title, as I understand that every individual brings something to the team - regardless of their years of experience.

I live by "open, honest and transparent" core values as I believe they are fundamental for any team to succeed.

My passion is for building - I spend my free time creating software, restoring old motorcycles, renovating or planning and building new furniture.

My journey with SCA started in Jun 2013 as a senior developer to work with their external agency who at the time was overseeing SCA digital assets. We have had over 70 radio stations and few TV channel websites.

It was a successful undertaking as the stability of the websites was dramatically improved, so did the quality and speed to market of our content and we ended up taking everything in-house.

## Co-Owner \hfill PropertySpy, NZ

\hfill _01/2007-01/2013_

Property Spy was a start up with a close friend that focused on a single problem of disparity and lack of information of real estate in New Zealand. The goal was to provide a single search engine for New Zealanders where they could see all the information about any property that was for sale or rent.

My contribution to this project was in the form of building the infrastructure, front-end solution architecture, as well as software development.

A number of real estate businesses did not appreciate our work and we were forced to shut down our project or face a very expensive legal battle. This was especially after a New Zealand Herald article was issued referring to our product and its usefulness. Attached is the article which refers to our site:

* humidity
* temperature

System can handle multiple sensors, pumps and solenoids. It can automatically water set of plants or manually triggered from your phone. This system can take care of plants for over a month (limitation being size of water tank).

## Knowledge sharing/documentation

I have been investigating a way of handling knowledge. This includes development documentation, management reports - even this CV.
Most recently I have been utilizing R-Markdown, LaTex, PanDoc, Python and R to see if there is a way of creating a single source of truth and then generate documentation for appropriate parties.

* This CV has been created using R-Markdown and can be outputted onto HTML, Word and PDF.
* Data is separated from visuals.
